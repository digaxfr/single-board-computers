# Raspberry Pi OS

This directory contains scripts to build out the bare minimum customized OS for Raspberry Pi OS. Its current target
platform is currently Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

`build.sh` is the current modern version which builds a LUKS encrypted root volulme. `customize-raspbian-image.sh`
is a legacy script that is kept around for historical reasons.
